# DropSimetricoPreparate
Adds custom keybinds to make both Player 1 and Player 2 jump/move from one key.

Mod idea, name, and logo by [ImRafael/NovaGD](https://discord.com/users/1337927591213924393).

To disable this mod, simply remove the keybinds from Geode's Custom Keybinds menu.

Default binds are `I` for jump, `J` to move left, and `L` to move right.
